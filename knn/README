Lab 1: kNN vs Logistic

Take a dataset on a direct marketing campaign run by a Portuguese bank and the output y is whether or not they subscribed to a term deposit. Note: the columns are delimited by semicolons rather than commas. Just pass delimiter=';' as a keyword argument in the call pandas.read_csv(.....) when you read the data in.

Part 1 of Code (KNN)
- Apply k-Nearest Neighbors on subsets of the columns and using cross validation to evaluate how the accuracy changes.
- Use KNN on all of the columns and see how the accuracy is

Part 2 (LOGISTIC)
- Use logistic regression on the data,  bucketing some of the column data into discrete categories rather than  continuous values.
- Try logistic regression on subsets of the columns to evaluate accruacy changes

Part 3 (COMPARE)
- Between logistic regression and kNN, which performed better in predicting which customers would sign on for a term deposit?
